    Macro that allows writing script tests which create a Bazel workspace and call the binary directly.

    These are intended to be like the Bazel integration tests found at https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/tree/master/src/test/shell/integration.

    Tests will find the Bazel binary via the `${BIT_BAZEL_BINARY}` environment variable.

    Args:
        name: name of the resulting test
        srcs: The file containing the shell script. This attribute must be a
            singleton list, whose only element is the shell script. This script
            must be executable, and may be a source file or a generated file. All
            other files required at runtime (whether scripts or data) belong in the
            deps attribute.
        deps: The list of library targets to be used in this test.
        bazel_binaries: Optional for WORKSPACE loaded repositories. Required
            for repositories that enable bzlmod. The value for this parameter
            is loaded by adding
            `load("@bazel_binaries//:defs.bzl", "bazel_binaries")` to your
            build file.
        bazel_version: Optional. A `string` value representing the semantic
                       version of Bazel to use for the integration test. If a
                       version is not specified, then the `bazel_binary` must
                       be specified.
