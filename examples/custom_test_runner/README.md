# Demonstrate a Custom Test Runner

This example demonstrates the implementation of a custom test runner. While the default test runner
is implemented using Bash shell scripts, `rules_bazel_integration_test` supports test runners
implemented in any language that can create an executable target. This example demonstrates
implementing a custom test runner using Swift.
